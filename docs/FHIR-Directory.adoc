= VZD-FHIR-Directory
The FHIR-Directory contains entries for healthcare services provided by organizations as well as practitioner entries. This page describes how to use the FHIR-Directory endpoints. See more information in https://fachportal.gematik.de/fachportal-import/files/gemSpec_VZD_FHIR_Directory_V1.1.0.pdf[[gemSpec_VZD_FHIR_Directory]].  It contains information about the endpoints and authentication methods.

== FHIR Profiles
The FHIR Profiles are defined in the Simplifier project https://simplifier.net/vzd-fhir-directory[VZD-FHIR-Directory]. 

TIP: In generell FHIR allows various search capabilities. The https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html[FHIR search] page describes in detail the search framework.

== Logical data structure
The FHIR-Directory has two kinds of entries, a organization and a practitioner entry. 

An *organization* entry has the following structure.

++++
<p align="left">
  <img width="60%" src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gematik/api-vzd/main/images/diagrams/ObjectDiagram.HealthcareService.svg>
</p>
++++

A *practitioner* entry has a similar structure.

++++
<p align="left">
  <img width="60%" src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gematik/api-vzd/main/images/diagrams/ObjectDiagram.PractitionerRole.svg>
</p>
++++

The *Endpoint* ressource contains the Matrix-User-ID (MXID) of a user or of a bot. The MXID are saved in the `HealthcareService.endpoint.address`.

For more information please have a look into https://github.com/gematik/api-vzd[[api-vzd]]

== REST Service Endpoints
The VZD-FHIR-Directory provides three endpoints: +

* `/search`, 
* `/owner` and 
* `tim-provider-services`. 

=== Endpoint: /search
The */search* endpoint is provided by the FHIR-Proxy to search for directory entries. This chapter describes how to use the FHIR-Proxy endpoint.

==== Authentication
The */search* endpoint requires a valid JSON Web Token (`tim-authenticate-token`) in the Authorization header. To get the token you need a 3rd Party Token from a permitted matrix-homeserver (`matrix-openid-token`) . With this token you can get the `tim-authenticate-token` from the */tim-authenticate* endpoint from the VZD-FHIR-Directory Auth Service. There are two steps necessary:

*1) Login to the matrix homeserver* 

*REQUEST*
====
[source,text]
----
POST https://{domain}/_matrix/client/r0/login
----
====

*RESPONSE*
====
[source,yaml]
----
...
BODY
{
  "user_id": "@user:matrix.dev.service-ti.de",
  "access_token": "matrix-accesstoken",
  "home_server": "matrix.dev.service-ti.de",
  "device_id": "SRCDQZFMLS"
}
----
====

*2) Request a 3rd Party Token from the matrix homeserver*

*REQUEST*
====
[source,text]
----
POST https://{domain}/_matrix/client/v3/user/{userid}/openid/request_token?access_token=matrix-accesstoken
----
====

*RESPONSE*
====
[source,yaml]
----
...
BODY
{
  "access_token": "matrix-openid-token",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "matrix_server_name": "matrix.dev.service-ti.de",
  "expires_in": 3600
}
----
====

Now, the following example shows the call to the */tim-authenticate* endpoint to get the `tim-authenticate-token`.

*REQUEST*
[source, text]
-----------------
GET https://fhir-directory-test.vzd.ti-dienste.de/tim-authenticate?mxId=matrix.dev.service-ti.de
-----------------

====
[source,yaml]
----
HEADER
{
  "User-Agent": "Faraday v2.6.0", 
  "Content-Type": "application/json", 
  "X-Matrix-OpenID-Token": "matrix-openid-token", 
  "X-Matrix-Server-Name": "matrix.dev.service-ti.de"
}
----
====

*RESPONSE*
[source, yaml]
-----------------
...
BODY
{
  "jwt": "tim-authenticate-token",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "expires_in": 86400
}
-----------------
 
The Response Body from the */tim-authenticate* endpoint contains the necessary JSON Web Token `jwt": "tim-authenticate-token`

==== /search Request
You can search two types of entries as discribed in the subchapter "Logical data structure"

To search for an organization entrie use: +

- */search/HealthcareService*

To search for a practitioner entrie use: +

- */search/PractitionerRole*

Organization entries and practitioner entries have status types. Only if the status is active you will find an entry. In the search-Request you have to include the search-parameter: `organization.active=true` or `practitioner.active=true` to realized that. 

TIP: The search response should include the referenced ressources (search parameter *_include=**).

TIP: For the */search* Request only active endpoints should be used (search parameter `endpoint.status=active`).

The FHIR Endpoint ressources are also used for other TI Applications e.g. https://github.com/gematik/api-kim[KIM]. For TI-Messenger-Clients it is recommended to use a search-parameter `endpoint.connection-type=tim`. This way only Endpoints with TI-Messenger addresses are found.

Please refer to the https://www.hl7.org/fhir/healthcareservice.html#search[HL7 FHIR documentation] to find the possible search parameters of each FHIR ressource.

The following example shows a search request to the VZD-FHIR-Directory

*REQUEST*
====
[source,text]
----
GET https://fhir-directory.vzd.ti-dienste.de/search/HealthcareService?organization.active=true&endpoint.status=active&_include=*&_count=2&_pretty=true
----
====

====
[source,yaml]
----
HEADER
{
  "User-Agent": "Faraday v2.6.0", 
  "Content-Type": "application/json", 
  "Authorization": "Bearer tim-authenticate-token"
}
----
====

*RESPONSE*
====
[source,yaml]
----
...
BODY
{
  "resourceType": "Bundle",
  "id": "0bd92f43-f603-4aab-b821-75043768da2c",
  "meta": {
    "lastUpdated": "2022-10-27T11:22:39.178+02:00"
  },
  "type": "searchset",
  "total": 2,
  "entry": 
  [
    {
      ...
      ...
      ...
     }
  ]
----

==== Display search results
The results of the search-request are summarized in a JSON FHIR Bundle structure. Each entry of the Bundle contains a FHIR ressource. The https://simplifier.net/VZD-FHIR-Directory/~introduction[FHIR-Directory simplifier page] specifies the _must support_ elements of the FHIR ressources. It is recommended to display at least those elements of the search results.

TIP: The search results can also contain FHIR data which is not marked as _must support_.

==== Full text search
IMPORTANT: Full text search is not yet supported by the FHIR-Directory

The search parameters, *_text* and *_content*, are used for full text search.


=== Endpoint: /owner
The */owner* endpoint is provided by the FHIR-Proxy to change directory entries by the owner of the entry. This chapter describes how to use the FHIR-Proxy endpoint.

==== Authentication
The ways to authenticate differ depending on the entry type (organization / practitioner entry). The https://fachportal.gematik.de/fachportal-import/files/gemSpec_VZD_FHIR_Directory_V1.1.0.pdf[specification of the FHIR-Directory] contains information about the endpoint and authentication methods.

*Organization entry*

The */owner* endpoint requires a valid JSON Web Token (`owner-accesstoken`) in the Authorization header. To get the token you need a 3rd Party Token from a permitted Registrierungs-Dienst (`RegService-OpenID-Token`). With this token you can get the `owner-accesstoken` from the */owner-authenticate* endpoint from the VZD-FHIR-Directory Auth Service. To get access to the FHIR ressources of the organization two steps are necessary:

.*1. Login to the Registrierungs-Dienst as Org-Admin*

This is a proprietary interface. Only healthcare organizations are permitted to take part in the TI-Messenger federation. Each TI-Messenger provider implements a way to authenticate a healthcare organization with OIDC and OAuth2. After the successful authentication the healthcare organization may create Org-Admin Accounts on the Registrierungsdienst.

.*2. Request a 3rd Party Token from the Registrierungs-Dienst*

After login the Org-Admin requests a token from the Registrierungs-Dienst.
This RegService-OpenID-Token can be exchanged for an owner-accesstoken by calling the /owner/authenticate endpoint of the VZD-FHIR-Directory.
