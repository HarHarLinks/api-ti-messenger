* *Registrierungs-Dienst:* +
The Registrierungs-Dienst offers two abstract interfaces. The interface `I_Registration` is called by the frontend of the Registrierungs-Dienst to authenticate an organization to the Registrierungs-Dienst and to administrate Messenger-Services. The interface `I_internVerfification` is called by the Messenger-Proxies to retrieve the federation list and to check for existing VZD-FHIR entries of the actors involved in an intended communication.

* *Messenger-Service:* +
A Messenger-Service consists of the subcomponents Messenger-Proxy and a Matrix-Homeserver. The subcomponent Matrix-Homeserver is based on the open communication protocol Matrix and offers the `Matrix-Client-Server API` and the `Matrix-Server-Server API`. Communication with a Matrix-Homeserver is always routed via the Messenger-Proxy, provided the authorization check was successful. This provides the interface `I_TiMessengerContactManagement` to enable the administration of an actor's release list.

* *Push-Gateway:* +
The Push-Gateway provides the `Matrix-Push Gateway API` according to the Matrix specification. This enables notifications to be forwarded to actors in the TI Messenger-Dienst.

link:docs/TI-Messenger-Client.adoc[*TI Messenger-Client*] +

* The TI-Messenger-Client is based on the `Matrix-Client-Server API`. It is expanded by further functional features and calls up the interfaces on the TI-Messenger-Fachdienst and on the VZD-FHIR--Directory.

link:docs/FHIR-Directory.adoc[*VZD-FHIR-Directory*] +

* The VZD-FHIR-Directory is a central TI-directory service that enables organizations and actors in the TI-Messenger-Dienst to be searched throughout Germany. The VZD-FHIR-Directory is based on the FHIR standard and offers relevant interfaces for the TI-Messenger-Dienst. The `I_VZD_TiMessenger_services` interface is called by the Registrierungs-Dienst to download a federation list. The interfaces `tim-authenticate` and `owner-authenticate` are called by the TI-Messenger-Clients to enable a search or to make an entry in the VZD-FHIR-Directory.
